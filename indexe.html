    <h4>Solar Bicycle</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>You can pedal it like a normal bicycle</strong><br />
        The main thing is still a bicycle. No helmet needed (legal).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Electric-powered movement</strong><br />
        Only for annoying roads or painful hills. About 1 km, it just moves by itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Automatic solar charging</strong><br />
        Solves the most annoying problem of e-bikes: charging.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Basket included, but still cool</strong><br />
        Baskets matter. I want to carry stuff.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What matters most is the feeling of
      <strong>"Moving around doesn’t feel annoying anymore"</strong>
      and that moving becomes easy.
